# ASSURE Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Computational Bootcamp 

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY%204.0-blueviolet.svg)](/LICENSE)

This repository contains materials for a Python based undergraduate bootcamp for the Space Sciences Lab REU program students at UC Berkeley organized from June 7 - 11, 2021. See more details on the Space Sciences Lab [education website](https://multiverse.ssl.berkeley.edu/ASSURE).

## Quick Start Guide

You can access these lessons 24/7, even after the bootcamp on Github repository at: github.com/abbyazari/ASSURE-REU. 

During the bootcamp (REU students only) you can access these through the [2i2c JupyterHub for Jupyter meets the Earth](https://hub.jupytearth.org/). You will need your Github account information to access these on the hub. 

Once logged in:
- Select the lowest computational allotement (top option).
- Navigate to the shared files, there you will see an ASSURE-REU folder. 
- Double click on "Intro.ipynb" and await further instructions.
