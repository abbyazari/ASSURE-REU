# ASSURE Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Computational Bootcamp 

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC%20BY%204.0-blueviolet.svg)](/LICENSE)

This repository contains materials for a Python based undergraduate bootcamp for the Space Sciences Lab REU program students at UC Berkeley organized from June 7 - 11, 2021. See more details on the Space Sciences Lab [education website](https://multiverse.ssl.berkeley.edu/ASSURE).

## Quick Start Guide

To access these lessons 24/7 including after the bootcamp on Github repository at: [github.com/abbyazari/ASSURE-REU](https://github.com/abbyazari/ASSURE-REU). 

During the bootcamp (bootcamp students only) you can access these through the [2i2c JupyterHub for Jupyter meets the Earth](https://hub.jupytearth.org/). You will need your Github account information to access these on the hub. 

**To access these materials for the bootcamp:**
- Log into [hub.jupyterearth.org](https://hub.jupytearth.org/).
- Select the lowest computational option (top option).
- Wait for the hub to load, then when loaded, open the terminal option (lower left).
- Type the following into the terminal `git clone https://github.com/abbyazari/ASSURE-REU/` and then hit enter
- Now on the left panel, double click on *CourseIntro.ipynb (under 06_08-Tuesday), raise your virtual hand on Zoom (so we know you have reached this point), and await further instructions. 

## Survival Guide Tips
